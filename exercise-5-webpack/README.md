# Exercise 5!

Now that we have a build system going, let's use Wepback to bundle up some new JavaScript modules for our site!

You'll need to:

- Make a `webpack.config.js`
- Point the entry at `/src/js/app.js`
- Point the output at `/src/js/app.min.js`
- Add the Wepback Babel Loader
- If you have time look at adding the Uglify plugin into Wepback!
